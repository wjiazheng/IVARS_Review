# Intraoperative Video Analysis in Robotic Surgery: A Literature Review 

Intraoperative video analysis has emerged as a pivotal technology in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, enabling real-time interpretation of laparoscopic visual streams to enhance surgical precision, operational safety, and postoperative recovery. 

We categorized intraoperative video analysis in robotic surgery into six core sub-tasks:  
*[Surgical Image Semantic Segmentation](#Surgical_Image_Semantic_Segmentation)*   
*[Surgical Action Triplet Recognition](#Surgical_Action_Triplet_Recognition)*  
*[Stereo Matching and 3D Reconstruction in Robotic Surgery](#Stereo_Matching_and_3D_Reconstruction_in_Robotic_Surgery)*   
*[Preoperative-to-intraoperative Image Registration](#Preoperative-to-intraoperative_Image_Registration)*  
*[Unsupervised Soft-tissue Tracking](#Unsupervised_Soft-tissue_Tracking)*  
*[Surgical Phase Recognition](#Surgical_Phase_Recognition)*
