# Intraoperative Video Analysis in Robotic Surgery: A Literature Review 

Intraoperative video analysis has emerged as a pivotal technology in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, enabling real-time interpretation of laparoscopic visual streams to enhance surgical precision, operational safety, and postoperative recovery. 
We categorized intraoperative video analysis in robotic surgery into six core sub-tasks: surgical image semantic segmentation, surgical action triplet recognition, stereo matching and 3d reconstruction in robotic surgery, preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration, unsupervised soft-tissue tracking, and surgical phase recognition.
