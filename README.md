Intraoperative video analysis has emerged as a pivotal technology in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, enabling real-time interpretation of laparoscopic visual streams to enhance surgical precision, operational safety, and postoperative recovery. 

We categorized intraoperative video analysis in robotic surgery into six core sub-tasks:  
*[Surgical Image Semantic Segmentation](#Surgical_Image_Semantic_Segmentation)*   
Surgical Action Triplet Recognition  
Stereo Matching and 3D Reconstruction in Robotic Surgery  
Preoperative-to-intraoperative Image Registration  
Unsupervised Soft-tissue Tracking  
Surgical Phase Recognition
